Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
HTTP1.1
It load resources in sequential manner, if one resources fails to load, it didn't block others.
image asserts keeps loading for longer time one after another to complete full image.
it compress data by itself.
it is in text based format.
it could handle only one request at a time, as result subsequent request had to wait for the previous request to complete.
it uses request resource inlining for use getting multiple pages.
http 2
it can send multiple streams of data simultaneously over a single TCP connections.
once the first few asserts starts loading, the following assets are loaded very quickly.
it use hpack for data compression that eliminates redundant information in HTTP header packets.
it use binary protocol making better at parsing and processing data.
using multiplexing, it effectively request the assest together and then receive them in the same way, all on the same connection.
it uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.

Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
objects:
objects are the collection of key: value pair
it is not restricted to data types, you can store all types of data types
compared to array, accessing the objects is quite easier
syntax of object:
var object name= {name: "guvi"}
where name is the key and guvi is tha value,
example:
var obj = {
    name: "guvi",
    age: 23,
    attendance=["mon","tue"]
}
to access the object we need tha key name, there are two method to access objects, 
dot method syntax: object name.key name
example: console.log(obj.name);
        console.log(obj.age);
        console.log(obj.attendance[0]);
box method syntax: object name["keyname"]
this mathod is used for in loop
syntax for (var i in obj){
console.log(obj[i]);
}
